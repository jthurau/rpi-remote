Web based, mobile friendly remote interface for the Raspberry Pi.

This addon utilizes jQuery Mobile and the remote API that comes packaged with OSMC, allowing users to control
their media players by connecting to a web page on their smart phones, tablets or laptops.

index.html is the main web page that connects all the code. You will find interface.js and interface.css in the
js and css folders, respectively. These files, along with index.html, contain the code I've written to make 
this work. 

I used Font Awesome for icons and jQuery Mobile for layout and events.
